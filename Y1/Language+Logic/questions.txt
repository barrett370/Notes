TRANSLATIONS FROM ENGLISH TO LOGIC

See in particular: Lec 7 & Ex 5, plus Lec 10 & Assm 3

NATURAL DEDUCTION PROOFS

In addition to the exercises/assessments on Canvas, Tomassi is a very good source of practice questions. There are no model solutions that I know of, but if you get stuck on any of the questions, feel free to ask in office hours, classes or the Facebook group. Below is a summary of where to find different types of proof questions.

Ex 2.2 (p.45) - translating english to prop logic
Ex 2.3 (p.53) - proofs using ∧-introduction/∧-elimination
Ex 2.4 (p.55) - proofs using →-elimination
Ex 2.5 (p.62) - proofs using →-introduction
Ex 2.6 (p.62) - proofs of theorems using →-introduction
Ex 3.2 (p.82) - proofs using double negation & modus tollens (some hard ones)
Ex 3.3 (p.85) - proofs using ∨-introduction
Ex 3.4 (p.90) - proofs using ∨-elimination
Ex 3.5 (p.91) - proofs using ∨-elimination
Ex 3.6 (p.93) - proofs using ∨-elimination
Ex 3.7 (p.100) - sub-proofs
Ex 3.8 (p.101) - more proofs
Ex 3.9 (p.106) - proofs using reduction ad absurdum
Revision exercises (p.108) - more prop logic proofs
Ex 3.10 (p.113) - more prop logic proofs (derived rules)
Ex 6.1 (p.272) - proofs using ∀-elimination
Ex 6.2 (p.281) - proofs using ∀-introduction
Ex 6.3 (p.286) - proofs using ∃-introduction
Ex 6.4 (p.292) - proofs using ∃-introduction
Ex 6.5 (p.302) - proofs using ∃-elimination
Ex 6.6 (p.309) - more pred calc proofs
Ex 6.7 (p.314) - proofs using identity
Revision exercises (p.328) - more pred calc proofs

STRUCTURAL INDUCTION

See Ex 9 and Lec 12.

In particular, the end of Lec 12 has an example that we did not have time to go through in the lecture, that you can test yourself on.
