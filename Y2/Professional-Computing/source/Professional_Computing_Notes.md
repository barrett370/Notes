#### Disruptive Innovation - an innovation that helps create a new market and value network, eventually disrupts existing market and value network, displacing all earlier technology. 

## Legal Perspectives 

### Criminal vs. Civil Law 
___
#### Criminal Law 
___ 
- Designed to protect "society" from wrong doers 
- Police investigation and arrest.
- Central Prosecution Service (CPS) proceed with prosecution.
- "Innocent until proven guilty".
- Must be proven "guilty beyond a reasonable doubt".
___
#### Civil Law 
___
- Settling Disputes between people (Companies can behave as people).
- Litigation must be *brought* by one of the parties of the dispute, they are the **plaintiff**, against the other, the **defendant** .
- Both parties must present arguments.
- Decision based on *balance of probabilities*
- Litigation is usually brought with the goal of obtaining damages ($$) or an injunction (court order).
___

#### Torts
- In Common Law, a Tort is a 'civil wrong'. 
- The action might not be necessarily illegal/ criminal but has still caused harm. Such harm can be addressed by courts 
- Torts-based litigation is usually solved through the awarding of damages.
  - Negligence - Duty of care, the plaintiff suffered damages as a result of the negligence of the defendant. 
  - Nuisance 
  - Defamation

#### Legalisation 
- A *"Legislative Act of Parliament* or *Statute* can create, amend or repeal any existing law.
- Any statute overrules any previous act or precedent, but not court decisions based on previous laws. 

#### Appeal 
- Appeal to Criminal Division of Court of Appeal 
  - Possible to overturn convictions/ court decisions based on appeal where new evidence can be presented and a new verdict given which can overturn or affirm a previous ruling.
___
## Computer Misuse Act of 1990 (CMA)
___
### 3 Offences: 
___
1. Unauthorised access to a computer .
2. Unauthorised access to a computer to commit a serious crime.
3. Unauthorised modification of the contents of a computer. 

#### 1. Unauthorised access to a computer
A person is guilty iff :
- They cause a computer to perform any function with intent to secure access to any program or data held in any computer 
- The access he intends to secure is unauthorised
- They know at the time when they cause the computer to perform the function that this is the case. 
- Punishable by a fine up to £5000 or 6 months imprisonment 
- **Key points**:
  - Knowledge & intent 
  - Attempt is insufficient 
  - No requirement of damage done 


#### 2. Intent to commit a serious crime

- eg. a blackmailer might hack into an email account to gain evidence of an affair 
- It is not necessary for the more serious crime to be carried out as long as intent to do so can be shown. 
- Punishable by 5 years imprisonment or an unlimited fine 


#### 3. Unauthorised Modification 

A person is guilty of an offence iff:
- They carry out any act which causes an unauthorised modification of the contents of any computer.
- At the time they carry out the act they have the requisite intent and knowledge.
  - Requisite Intent covers:
    - To impair the operation of any computer 
    - to prevent or hinder access to any program or data held in any computer 
    - to impair the operation of any such program or the reliability of any such data. 
- Punishable by 5 years imprisonment or an unlimited fine. 
- Examples of offences include:
  - Spreading a virus 
  - Encrypting files and demanding a ransom for revealing the key 
  - Redirection of a browser to certain pages. 
___
### Review of CMA
___
- All party review of the act
- Input from professional bodies 
- Added an additional offence 
  - Impairing access to data 
  - Motivated by DDOS attacks 
- Increased tariff for unauthorised access (1) from 6 months to 2 years imprisonment 
  - To show this is a serious crime
  - A crime which is extraditable under UK law.
- Still relatively few prosecutions under CMA 
___
### Issues with CMA 
___
- Common view is that the real issue with Computer crime is a lack of resources for investigation and prosecution other than laws.
___
### Serious Crime Act of 2015 
___
- Created to alleviate pressures from EU law makers 

- Resulted in 2 main amendments to the CMA: 
  - Anyone obtaining malware can be prosecuted before they even steal any personal information. 
  - Any UK nationals, previously escaping law can now be prosecuted. 

- EU nationals can be extradited to their relevant countries under a blanket directive.

- Monitored by the Information Commissioner 

### Issues with the FOI Act

- Potential conflicts between FOI requests and GDPR/DPA in cases where there is personal data 
- Usually, FOI requests must be answered within one month of receipt
  - sometimes impossible 
  - FOI requests have been used to "punish" perceived slights 
  - Public organisations need to develop the necessary infrastructure to handle FOI requests. Often this cost is passed via FOI request charge 
 
 ## Intellectual Property (IP)
 ___

 - **Theft** = *The intentional taking of somebody else's property with the intention of permanently depriving them of it*
 
 ### Copyright $\copyright$
 ___
 - Copyright, Design and Patents Act of 1988
 - Copyright (computer programs) Regulations of 1992

- The owner of an IP work has certain exclusive rights:
  - The right to:
    - make copies of the work
    - issue copies of the work to the public (paid | free)

- It is not infringement to:
  - Make a backup of a program you are authorised to use (only 1 copy)
  - You can decompile code to correct any errors
  - You can sell your right to use a program 
    - but you must destroy any copies you have

- Secondary infringement
  - Primary infringement in a business context
    - selling copies
    - using pirated software in a business context
  - Criminal issue
    - Large fines, imprisonment 
  
-**DRM**
- Many pieces of software use DRM 
  - providing information about how to avoid DRM is the same as actual copyright infringement (as of the 1988 Copyright, Design and Patents Act)
___
### Patents 
___
- Patents Act of 1977
- A patent is a temporary right granted by the state enabling the inventor to prevent other people from copying his work without permission
- Patents must be applied for (are not automatic)
  - Are far stronger than Copyright
    - Prevents other people from coming up with the same solution
  - Patents were meant to encourage innovation 
    - reward an inventor with a grace period to recoup development costs

- For a product to be patented it must be:
  - New 
  - Involves an inventive step
    - isn't an obvious solution 
  - Is capable of industrial application    
    - is practical
  - Is not in an area specifically excluded i.e. no:
    - Scientific theories 
    - Mathematical Methods
    - Literary/ dramatic/ artistic work
    - Presentation of information
    - A scheme, rule or method for performing a mental act (includes computer programs)

-**Obtaining and enforcing**

- Patents are granted nationally 
- Technically you need to apply in each country 
- Trade schemes such as WIPO, European PO etc. eliminate this requirement
- Timing is crucial 
  - Data of initial applicaion determines what is "new"
  - Full paten specification requires specialist work
  - Often takes 4 years to complete
- Computing being a global business requires the patent to be taken out in enough countries for it to be challengeable
- Enforcing is difficult
- Many are contested 

- Software can be patented iff: 
  - It is part of a product that can be patented 
  - Controls some process with a physical effect 
  - Processes data that arises from the natural world

|Pros | Cons |
|-----|------|
|- Patents allow for financial rewards for innovators and creators| - software has been successful without patents  |
| - Fund future research | - Patents allow big companies to claim basic computer functionality as their exclusive right|
|- Fund computer scientists | - A great deal of software has already been written without patents, leading to retrospective patents being granted| 
| |- Most original development is done by small companies, which is then licensed to/ exploited by big companies|
___
### Copyleft 
___
- Political/Software Philosophy
  - Software is released as "free"
  - No restrictions on re-use/modification/ copying

#### Fixed price contracts
___
- Typically tailor-made, bespoke systems
- Short agreement 
  - Who the parties are 
  - what has been said before is not part of the contract
- Standard T&C 
  - How the supplier normally does business 
- A set of schedules/ annexes
  - PArticular requirements of the contract
  - What is supplied 
  - Deadlines
  - What payments are to be made 
  - etc.
  
___
#### Contract Stipulations 
___
##### What is to be produced?
- The contract must define a product 

- Good requirement specifications are hard to produce

  - Command files for building executables 
  - Documentation
  - Reference/training/ operations manuals 
  - Training
  - Test data & results

- Ownership
  - Who owns the IP for the software?
- Confidentiality 
  - Should be specified for both parties 

##### Payment
- Unlikely for a clause to exist stipulating a due date of payment with consequences otherwise such as surcharges or break of contract 

- Payment is more likely to be staggered
  - Initial Payment of 15% on signing 
  - Stage payments during development 
  - 25% at acceptance of software
  - 10% at end of contract 

- Such a system is designed to protect the supplier
  - Client may go out of business 
  - Cash flow for the supplier 

- Staggering can be done by
  - calendar month (benefits supplier)
  - by project completion (benefits client)

##### Penalty Clauses 

- Payment clauses protect the supplier but the client may also add penalty clauses 

- e.g. reduced payment of £x per week project overrun up to a maximum of y%

##### Obligations on the client

- Contract needs to specify client obligations 
  - Provide documentation 
  - Provide access to appropriate staff 
  - Provide machine facilities for testing 
  - etc.
  
  - Most suppliers will have their own standards of testing and quality assurance 
  - Large clients will prefer to use their own 
    - Must be specified in the contract 

##### Acceptance, Warranty & Indemnity
- Acceptance 
  - Client must provide fixed set of acceptance tests
  - Successful demonstration of system will constitute acceptance 

- Warranty 
  - Standard is 90 days
  - Any identified errors are fixed free of charge 
  - Beyond this is subject to negotiation 

- Indemnity 
  - Risk of supplier infringing on IP rights of third party
  - usual for contract to indemnify client and supplier so each are not liable for any infringement by the other due to their own fault

##### Termination and Arbitration 
- Termination 
  - It is not uncommon for projects to be cancelled 
    - Client goes bust / merges / 
    - Technology is not obsolete

  - Contract must specify what payments are made to the supplier in such circumstances 

- Arbitration 
  - Contracts are complex 
  - Litigation is expensive (often not worthwhile)
  - Contract may specify that in the case of a dispute the option of an independent arbitrator will decide 
  - Avoids legal costs
___
#### Time and Materials Contracts 
___
- Also referred to as a *"Cost Plus"* contract 
- Supplier agrees to develop software 
  - payment based on costs incurred plus daily rate
    
- Acceptance tests and payment is often much simpler 

- Often cheaper than fixed price contracts
- Sometimes project is unclear meaning fixed price is impossible 
___
#### Contract Hire & Consultancy 
___
- Fixed price contracts are complex 
- Contract hire offers a simple alternative 
  - Supplier provides services of staff for a fixed period
  - Agreed hourly/ daily rates
  - Client takes responsibility for managing staff 
  - Termination by either side can be done at short notice

- Consultancy - Expert analysis is a key part of business
  - Usually produces a report
  - Done at a fixed price but
    - small amount of cash involved
    - harder for a report to fail an acceptance test
    - reputation of a consultant is a good guarantee 

- Issues with Consultancy 
  - Confidentiality 
    - Need to be safeguards to ensure consultant doesn't profit against the client following the project
  - Terms of reference
    - what is the consultant mean to be looking at? 
    - often changes during the course of the project 
    - major source of disagreements 
  - Who approves the final report? 
    - Usually client approves draft
    - May require amendments 
    - Might damage consultants reputation
  - Liability 
    - Few consultants want to be liable for the advice they give
    - Most clients want them to be liable 

___
