<h2 id="intro-to-quantum-mechanics">Intro to Quantum Mechanics</h2>

<ul>
<li>Theory describing the smallest structures in the universe</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="useful-quantum-properties-for-cs">Useful Quantum Properties for CS</h3>

<ul>
<li>Superposition: If a system can be in a state $A$ or state $B$, it can also be in a <em>mixture</em> of the two</li>
<li>Measurements, if we measure a system that is in a superposition of states $A$ and $B$, we see either A or B probabilistically. Repeated measurements without resetting will give the same result as the first measurement.</li>
<li>Uncertainty: pairs of measurements where greater certainty in one measurement causes lower certainty in another</li>

<li><p>Entanglement. There exist states of multipartite systems which cannot be described in terms of states of the constituent systems.</p></li>

<li><p>At first these do not seem to be useful properties however, we will see that in certain situations they can be.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="superposition-and-measurement-schrodinger-s-cat">Superposition and measurement: Schrodinger&rsquo;s cat</h4>

<ul>
<li>No one has managed to actually carry out the experiment</li>
<li>If a particle decaying was linked to a poison being released in a box with a cat then by extension of the particle being both decayed and not decayed (superposition) we can say that the cat is both dead and not dead.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="qubit">Qubit</h4>

<ul>
<li>These are the basic building-block of a quantum computer</li>
<li>A quantum system with 2 distinct states is a <em>qubit</em>

<ul>
<li>People haven&rsquo;t decided on which quantum system is best for the application of computers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>One such system is that of a photon, these have a property called polarisation which can be vertical or horizontal</li>
<li>Qubits are to quantum computers as Bits are to conventional computers</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="entanglement">Entanglement</h4>

<ul>
<li>If we had a pair of entangled qubits we cannot describe the state of either particle independently. But we can describe the joint state of the two particles</li>
<li>Particles can be entangled over vast distances.<br />

<ul>
<li>allows us to have information about particles very far away by examining particles entangled to them.</li>
<li>We can use this property for communication protocols</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Entanglement can be between more than 2 particles/ qubits</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quantum-simulation">Quantum Simulation</h2>

<ul>
<li>No (known) efficient general-purpose method to simulate quantum physics on a conventional computer</li>
<li>Richard Feynaman first wondered if a quantum computer could be created to solve this.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="shor-s-algorithm-for-factoring">Shor&rsquo;s Algorithm for Factoring</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Peter Shor shows that quantum computer can factorise large integers efficiently</p></li>

<li><p>Given an integer $N = p \times q$ for prime numbers $p$ and $q$, Shor&rsquo;s algorithm outputs $p$ and $q$</p></li>

<li><p>No efficient classical algorithm</p></li>

<li><p>THe quantum part of the algorithm uses period finding, given a function $f: \Z \rightarrow \Z$ and the promise that there exists a number $a$ st. $f(x+a) = f(x) \forall x$, find $a$</p></li>

<li><p>This algorithm would break the RSA public key crypto-system on which internet security is based.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="grover-s-algorithm-for-unstructured-search">Grover&rsquo;s algorithm for Unstructured Search</h3>

<ul>
<li>Imagine we have $n$ boxes, each containing 0 or 1, We can look inside a box at the cost of 1 query</li>
<li>We want to find a box containing a 1. on a classical computer this would take $n$ queries in the worst case</li>
<li>Lov Grover created a quantum algorithm which can solve this is around $\sqrt{n}$ queries</li>
<li>Could be the basis of quantum machine learning</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-hll-algorithm-for-solving-systems-of-linear-equations">The HLL algorithm for solving systems of linear equations</h3>

<ul>
<li>Given a $N\times N$ matrix $\textbf{A}$ and a unit vector $\vec{b}$, find the vector $\vec{x}$ satisfying $\textbf{A}\vec{x} = \vec{b}$

<ul>
<li>We dont get $\vec{x}$ tself</li>
<li>The matrix $\textbf{A}$ needs to be <em>sparse</em></li>
<li>Running time is $O(\log(N)\kappa^2)$ vs $O(N\kappa)$ on a standard computer</li>
<li>$\kappa$ is the condition number of $\textbf{A}$ which is roughly the ratio of the largest and smallest eigenvalue</li>
<li>Applications include machine learning and big data</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="secure-quantum-computing-in-the-cloud">Secure Quantum Computing in the cloud</h3>

<ul>
<li>The <em>blind quantum computing</em> protocol

<ul>
<li>Allows the secure delegation of quantum computations to a quantum server. Client does not need any quantum compute capability</li>
<li>The server learns nothing about the data or type of computation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="programming-a-quantum-computer">Programming a Quantum Computer</h2>

<p><strong><em>Could not replicate diagrams, will try and link slide deck</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Quantum measurements are probabilistic and irreversible. Making measurements often lose quantum effects</li>

<li><p>Unitary operations are deterministic, reversible and maintain <em>quantumness</em></p>

<ul>
<li>These tend to make up the bulk of quantum computation.</li>
<li>They are written using <em>quantum circuits</em></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Horizontal wires represent qubits</p></li>

<li><p>gates represent operations on one or more qubits</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A Qubit state is described by a unit vector $\begin{pmatrix} a \ b\end{pmatrix}$ where $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers satisfying:</p>

<p>$$|a|^2 + |b|^2 - 1$$
Given a single qubit we can&rsquo;t learn the blaues of $a$ and $b$ a measurement will give the outcome $0$ with probabiliy $|a|^2$ and the outcome $1$ with a probability $|b|^2$</p>

<p>So the vector $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \ 0 \end{pmatrix}$</p>

<p>The state of 2 qubits is descibed by a vector of length 4 whose components determine the prob. of each combination of individual states</p>

<p>A state of $n$ cubits is described by a vector of length $2^n$ whose components deterine the probabilities for all the different $n$-bit strings</p>

<h3 id="reversible-logic-gates-as-unitary-operations">Reversible logic gates as unitary operations</h3>

<p>The NOT gate corresponds to the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}$</p>

<h2 id="building-quantum-computers">Building Quantum Computers</h2>

<p>As mentioned earlier, there are different approaches using different quantum systems</p>

<ul>
<li>Light: Photons are hard to interact with which makes them less suseptable to noise but also harder to run programs with</li>
<li>Ion Trap</li>
<li>Superconducting chipsets</li>
</ul>

<p>All approaches require very low temperatures to remove a lot background noise</p>

<h3 id="quantum-error-correction">Quantum Error Correction</h3>

<p>Building large scale quantum computers is very difficult due to <em>decoherence</em>
If a quantum computer interacts with the outside world is can lose its <em>quantumness</em> and behave like a classical computer</p>

<ul>
<li>Quantum error correcting codes can be used to fight decoherence</li>
<li>But they are far from perfect &amp; decoherence is still a major issue</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum-computing">Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum Computing</h3>

<p>Often abbreviated to NISQ</p>

<ul>
<li>Noisy : do not use error correction</li>
<li>Intermediate-Scale: 50-100 qubits</li>
</ul>

<p>Computations should be kept short to avoid errors accumulating. However, they are still expected to outperform standard computers on certain tasks.</p>

<p>too many diagrams from here, cannot keep up</p>
