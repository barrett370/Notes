<p>In order to make good use of the hardware we consider 3 stages:</p>

<ol>
<li>Many small sequences

<ul>
<li>Each less than one <em>block size</em></li>
<li>Here there are many small merges to do</li>
<li>Each thread can do 1 merge</li>
<li>Each block handles many merges</li>
<li>Memory coalescing: better &hellip;</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="bitonic-sort">Bitonic Sort</h3>

<ul>
<li>A comparitor is a function that swaps two elements if they are in th wrong order</li>
<li>A monotonic increasing/decreasing sequence is one where very element is equal to or greater/less than every preceding element</li>
<li>A bitonic sequence is a sequence which changes order direct at most once, or a circular shift of such a sequence.

<ul>
<li>Circular shift means that we can take the sequence 1,2,10,11,9,4 which is bitonic and write it as 9,4,1,2,10,11 and it is still bitonic</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The central idea behind Bitonic sort:</p>

<ul>
<li>A simple parallel arrangement of comparators can split a bitonic sequence into two bitonic sequences where all elements of the first are less than all elements of the second</li>
</ul>
