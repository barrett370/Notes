## What is Swarm Intelligence?

> Swarm Intelligence: Collective behaviour of decentralised self-organised natural or artificial systems

- Self organising system:
  - An initially disordered system, but *global phenomina* such as order or coordination will arise out of *local interactions* between its components


A swarm intelligence system typically consists of simple agents interacting with each other and their environment following simple rules

## Why have they developed?

There is no clear explanation for the evolution of swarm behaviour. Some possible explanations include:

- Better defence, early warning or confusing a predator
- Better foraging efficiency
- Saving energy, birds flying in formation often see reduced energy usage

## What is Swarm Intelligence in CS?

In Computer Science we define Swarm Intelligence as a *Multi-agent system that has self-organised behaviour that shows some intelligent behaviour*

There are two main fields of research:

1) Swarm iIntelligence algorithms
   - Ant colony optimisation: An algorithm inspired by ants' collective behaviour, useful for combinatorial optimisation problems such as path finding.
   - Particle swarm Optimisation

2) Swarm Robotics: design coordination of multi-robot systems which consist of large numbers of mostly simple robots.
   - Goes beyond distributed systems, aims to promote scalability
