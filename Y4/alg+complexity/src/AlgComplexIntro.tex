\section{About the module}

\begin{itemize}
\item This is an entirely theoretical module
  \item We will be required to write proofs
  \item We will not be required to implement anything in a programming language.
  \item We have a midterm continuous assessment worth 25\% of the grade in week 6 (beginning 8th March)
  \item End term continuous assessment worth 25\% of the grade in week 12 (beginning 10th May)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Plan of teaching}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Two weeks on complexity taught by Paul Levy
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Foundations of complexity: Turing machines, time adn space complexity
          \item Complexity classes and relations between them
        \end{itemize}
  \item Six weeks on Algorithms taught by Rejesh Chitnis
        \begin{itemize}
\item Classical algorithmic
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

There will be a weekly formative assignment
