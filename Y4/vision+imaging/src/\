* Topic Overview

Robot vision is a subset of Computer vision

* Introduction to Computer Vision

** A brief history of biological vision

- Vision can be traced back around 543M years.
- Around this time, the number of different species /exploaded/
- We believe vision was responsible for this phase of evolution.
- Humans have around 50% of our neural tissue linked directly or indirectly to

** History of Computational Vision
One of the first academic works in computer vision was /Block World/ in 1963 by Larry Roberts. Here the world is translated into simple geometric shapes with the goal being to identify and understand what these shapes are.

Another influential figure in modern computer vision is David Marr.
*** Though process of David Marr

Marr's process of thinking about computation representations of images follows very closely to what neuroscientists believe happens inside the human brain.
